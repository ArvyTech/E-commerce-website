Welcome to my e-commerce website, a project I developed during my college days to gain hands-on experience with coding languages and frameworks. This site is entirely built on React, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've implemented React components for efficient page navigation, server handling, and other essential features.
including simulation of Payment Gateway also.

I invite you to explore the website and see how I've applied my learning to create a user-friendly online shopping platform.
